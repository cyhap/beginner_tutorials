Navigating the File System:
- It appears that there are no files added to the repository when completing this tutorial.

Creating Package:
- Used the catkin_create_pkg command as outlined in the tutorial. This added a number of additional directories and files. Modified the manifest (package.xml)

Building Package:
- Note the building of this package was actually an instruction in Creating Package tutorial as well. No new files were added. (The build directory resides in the catkin_ws and we were instructed not to include that in our github repository.)

Understanding Nodes:
-  This tutorial primarily focused on running the ros nodes and understanding how they work. No new files were added.

Understanding Topics:
- Again this tutorial did not require the addition of new fields. Topics and messages were explored along with the usage of rqt_graph and rqt_plot

Writing Publisher Subscriber:
- Wrote the Talker and Listener Rosnodes outlined by the tutorial. Modified the cmakelist accordingly.

Examining Publisher Subscriber:
- Ran the publisher and subscriber that was written and built in the last tutorial. Note in order to run these packages the setup.bash script needed to be sourced in each terminal in order to run each node. No additional files added.
